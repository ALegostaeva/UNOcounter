# UNOcounter
The UNO Counter allows you to count points during the board game UNO. The Counter is a replacement for pieces of paper, a calculator and notes on a phone.

Uno Counter is the result of my first 'mini-project' of 2018. It's a good challenge for me as a noobie, for learning a lot of thing such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GIT.

## Getting Started
You can start to use the counter here: [click](https://alegostaeva.github.io)

## Features
1. You can create a session of game. It looks like a table with names and points. Score is calculated automatically.
2. You can save a session of game.
3. You can load saved session of game.
